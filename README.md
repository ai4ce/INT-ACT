This is a template for turning your awesome research project into a project website. Most of the code are shamelessly stolen online from somewhere else. Click [here](https://irvingf7.github.io/ai4ce_project_website_template/) to see it in action.

`index.html` is the major file you will be editing, and it has some comments to guide you. 

I am not familiar with HTML/CSS/JavaScript, so if you have better way to do some of the things in the project, or have more presentable web designs, don't hesitate to contribute to this repo!

# Switchable Videos
One thing I found bothering is that many project websites have a huge list of video dump. This makes the page unnecessarily long, and is disastrous on mobile as all videos will pop up all at once.

In the `Video Comparison` section, there are code showing how to switch between videos using buttons.

<b>Note:</b> There are three total ways to do switchable content in this website. You can use any one of them if appropriate.

# Switchable Text and Images
For similar reason, there is a `Method Overview` section that shows text and images that can be switched.

# Switchable `div`
A `div` is sort of like the most basic container block of HTML. `More Visualization` section provide an example on switching between `div`, allowing maximum flexibility.

# Miscellaneous 
This website is originally for a reconstruction project, so there are some items, such as the JuxtaposeJS sliders, that may not be suitable for your needs. Feel free to delete them as the code base is very modular.
